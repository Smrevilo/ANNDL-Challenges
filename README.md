# What are this notebooks

This repository has the following folders, 

* Baseline: This consists of a model that uses a random guessing in order to solve the task
* Hyperparameter search (hp-searching): This has the notebooks used for the bayesian search of the hyperparameters
* Preprocessing: This has the notebooks used for outlier detection and advance augmentation pipeline.
* Trainning: It has the notebooks used for trainning the best model (0.94 accuracy)
  
Most folders have an additional sub-folder that's called experiments which contains notebooks used for the intermediate models generated.

Additionally, there is the notebook model_comparison which describes synthetically some of the different network architectures that was explored.
